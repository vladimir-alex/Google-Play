# Google-Play

## About Dataset

> While many public datasets provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found out that the iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery, making scraping more challenging.

## Introduction

> From the google play store dataset, I decide to make a notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and do some wrangling data to put it on my prediction model in future.

## Important

> There are many charts on github that do not display, you can get the full chart display by copying the URL of the notebook to https://nbviewer.org/.
> Here is a link ready for direct viewing.
